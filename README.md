# Bash Aliases Scripts

A Bash alias is a method of supplementing or overriding Bash commands with new ones.

## Getting Started

The following are the types of aliases for various functionalities,

-	.ssh_aliases (For ssh to servers using just an host name)

## Steps

-	`git clone https://github.com/yebh17/bash_aliases.git`
-   `cd bash_aliases`
-	`cp aliases_* ~/`
-	`source .aliases_*`

**# Now you can ssh into the machines just by running the host name.**

**# Note: If you wanted to use only any of one specific aliases script, just copy that aliases script to your home folder and source that script.**
